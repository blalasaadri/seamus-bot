According to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/gormanseamus/status/969659657215242240), Seamus Gorman ([@gormanseamus](https://twitter.com/gormanseamus)) feels like he's being asked whether he has been hacked after every tweet.
To rescue him from his uncertainty, this bot WILL ask him whether he's been hacked after every non-reply tweet.

You're welcome.
